# NHIF Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a data analysis and visualization project focused on NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund) data. It aims to provide insights and visualizations related to NHIF data, including correlations, trends, and patterns over time. The project involves data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **data**: Contains the dataset used in the analysis.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with the Python code used for data analysis and visualization.
- **visualizations**: Plots and visualizations generated from the analysis.
- **README.md**: You are reading it right now.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to explore the data analysis process.

## Dependencies
